# 🔐 NullPass

**NullPass** is a passwordless, OTP-less authentication system that uses **cryptographic identity** instead of shared secrets.  
It is designed to be phishing-resistant and eliminates risks from password leaks and SMS-based attacks.

## 🧠 Concept

Traditional authentication relies on **something you know** (passwords, OTPs).  
NullPass relies on **cryptographic proof generated by the user’s device**.

- No shared secrets  
- No reusable credentials  
- No OTP interception
