# NullPass
NullPass is a high-security Digital Security System (DSS) designed to eliminate the vulnerabilities of traditional credentials. By replacing passwords and SMS-based OTPs with device-bound cryptographic identity, NullPass provides a phishing-resistant framework that ensures "zero shared secrets" between the user and the server.
